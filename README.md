Dine--Don-t-Dash
================

This program takes input of an ID and matches it to an account, which it then charges based on what time of day it is (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

It is intended to be used with a barcode scanner or some other form of input to quickly read ID cards.
There is a lot of extranneous code because the project originally included a point of sales application for a small store, but this was later dropped from the project.
